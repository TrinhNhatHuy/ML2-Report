\section{Results}
This section presents the experimental results obtained from different classification models on the Covertype dataset. We evaluate model performance under two scenarios: training with and without SMOTE to address class imbalance. 

The comparison focuses on both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Performance is assessed using Balanced Accuracy, Macro F1-score, Weighted F1-score, and Cohen's Kappa, while computational cost is measured in terms of training and prediction time. 

The objective is to analyze the trade-offs between accuracy, robustness to class imbalance, and computational complexity across different machine learning models.
\subsection{Overall Performance Comparison}

This subsection provides a comprehensive comparison of model performance 
under two experimental settings: training without SMOTE and training with SMOTE. 
We evaluate classification effectiveness using Balanced Accuracy, Macro F1-score, 
Weighted F1-score, and Cohen’s Kappa. In addition, computational efficiency 
is assessed through training time and prediction time. The objective is to 
identify performance trade-offs across different machine learning models 
and to analyze the impact of SMOTE on imbalanced data handling.
