\section{Methodology}

This section describes the systematic approach used to analyze the Covertype dataset, prepare it for machine learning, and evaluate model performance. We organized our methodology into two main phases: data analysis and preprocessing, followed by class imbalance handling and model selection, and ended with model evaluation.
